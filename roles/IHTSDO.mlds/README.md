# default template role  - edit to suit
Directories:
files:       This directory contains regular files that need to be transferred 
             to the hosts you are configuring for this role. 
             This may also include script files to run.
             
handlers:    All handlers that were in your playbook previously can now be added 
             into this directory.

meta:        This directory can contain files that establish role dependencies. 
             You can list roles that must be applied before the current role can 
             work correctly.
             
templates:   You can place all files that use variables to substitute 
             information during creation in this directory.
             
tasks:       This directory contains all of the tasks that would normally be in 
             a playbook. 
             These can reference files and templates contained in their 
             respective directories without using a path.
             
vars:        Variables for the roles can be specified in this directory and used 
             in your configuration files.

Within all of the directories but the "files" and "templates", if a file called 
main.yml exists, its contents will be automatically added to the playbook 
that calls the role.
